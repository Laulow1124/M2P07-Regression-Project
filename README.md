# M2P07 Regression Project
--------

**The objective of the M2P07 Regression Project is to explore multiple regression models, in order to find a model that predicts the rental price most accurately.**

**The material applied from Module 2 will be the following:**
1. Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
2. Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Regularization

**M2P07 Regression Project has the following conditions:**
1. Project must include EDA section.
2. Project must include visualization.
3. Data must be cleaned and prepared.
4. Use Feature Engineering, if applicable.
5. Must compare at minimum 3 regression models.
6. Explain which feature(s) are chosen for final model.
7. Use final model to make new predictions based on my provided input.

**The outline for the project will be the following:**

**The project will be split into five parts:**
1. Part 1 will involve EDA, Visualization, Data Cleaning, Encoding, Data Preparation (ex: Split to X and y).  <br>
2. Part 2 will be working with Model #1: Simple Linear Regression. <br>
3. Part 3 will be working with Model #2: Polynomial Regression. <br>
4. Part 4 will be working with Model #3: Polynomial Regression, with RidgeCV L2 Regularization. <br>
5. Part 5 will be determining which of the three models has the best performance and having the best performing model be our final model. <br>
   The final model will be used to make a prediction and includes some final comments/conclusion. <br>
